## PyStarting

- This is a repository with my creations made for my Instagram page (@pystarting)
- The main objective of these contents is to help and encourage more people to learn and venture into the giant world of programming with Python
- Temporarily, the files are only in Portuguese
- I hope you like these contents ;)

  _Sincerely, Lucas Morais_
